# ユーザ定義演算子

## はじめに
Welcome to Chapter 6 of the “Implementing a language with LLVM” tutorial. At this point in our tutorial, we now have a fully functional language that is fairly minimal, but also useful. There is still one big problem with it, however. Our language doesn’t have many useful operators (like division, logical negation, or even any comparisons besides less-than).

This chapter of the tutorial takes a wild digression into adding user-defined operators to the simple and beautiful Kaleidoscope language. This digression now gives us a simple and ugly language in some ways, but also a powerful one at the same time. One of the great things about creating your own language is that you get to decide what is good or bad. In this tutorial we’ll assume that it is okay to use this as a way to show some interesting parsing techniques.

At the end of this tutorial, we’ll run through an example Kaleidoscope application that renders the Mandelbrot set. This gives an example of what you can build with Kaleidoscope and its feature set.

## ユーザ定義演算子の考え方

The “operator overloading” that we will add to Kaleidoscope is more general than in languages like C++. In C++, you are only allowed to redefine existing operators: you can’t programmatically change the grammar, introduce new operators, change precedence levels, etc. In this chapter, we will add this capability to Kaleidoscope, which will let the user round out the set of operators that are supported.

The point of going into user-defined operators in a tutorial like this is to show the power and flexibility of using a hand-written parser. Thus far, the parser we have been implementing uses recursive descent for most parts of the grammar and operator precedence parsing for the expressions. See Chapter 2 for details. By using operator precedence parsing, it is very easy to allow the programmer to introduce new operators into the grammar: the grammar is dynamically extensible as the JIT runs.

The two specific features we’ll add are programmable unary operators (right now, Kaleidoscope has no unary operators at all) as well as binary operators. An example of this is:

```
# Logical unary not.
def unary!(v)
  if v then
    0
  else
    1;

# Define > with the same precedence as <.
def binary> 10 (LHS RHS)
  RHS < LHS;

# Binary "logical or", (note that it does not "short circuit")
def binary| 5 (LHS RHS)
  if LHS then
    1
  else if RHS then
    1
  else
    0;

# Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.
def binary= 9 (LHS RHS)
  !(LHS < RHS | LHS > RHS);
```

Many languages aspire to being able to implement their standard runtime library in the language itself. In Kaleidoscope, we can implement significant parts of the language in the library!

We will break down implementation of these features into two parts: implementing support for user-defined binary operators and adding unary operators.

## ユーザ定義のバイナリ演算子
Adding support for user-defined binary operators is pretty simple with our current framework. We’ll first add support for the unary/binary keywords:

```
enum Token {
  ...
  // operators
  tok_binary = -11,
  tok_unary = -12
};
...
static int gettok() {
...
    if (IdentifierStr == "for")
      return tok_for;
    if (IdentifierStr == "in")
      return tok_in;
    if (IdentifierStr == "binary")
      return tok_binary;
    if (IdentifierStr == "unary")
      return tok_unary;
    return tok_identifier;
```

This just adds lexer support for the unary and binary keywords, like we did in previous chapters. One nice thing about our current AST, is that we represent binary operators with full generalisation by using their ASCII code as the opcode. For our extended operators, we’ll use this same representation, so we don’t need any new AST or parser support.

On the other hand, we have to be able to represent the definitions of these new operators, in the “def binary| 5” part of the function definition. In our grammar so far, the “name” for the function definition is parsed as the “prototype” production and into the PrototypeAST AST node. To represent our new user-defined operators as prototypes, we have to extend the PrototypeAST AST node like this:

```
/// PrototypeAST - This class represents the "prototype" for a function,
/// which captures its argument names as well as if it is an operator.
class PrototypeAST {
  std::string Name;
  std::vector<std::string> Args;
  bool IsOperator;
  unsigned Precedence;  // Precedence if a binary op.

public:
  PrototypeAST(const std::string &name, std::vector<std::string> Args,
               bool IsOperator = false, unsigned Prec = 0)
  : Name(name), Args(std::move(Args)), IsOperator(IsOperator),
    Precedence(Prec) {}

  Function *codegen();
  const std::string &getName() const { return Name; }

  bool isUnaryOp() const { return IsOperator && Args.size() == 1; }
  bool isBinaryOp() const { return IsOperator && Args.size() == 2; }

  char getOperatorName() const {
    assert(isUnaryOp() || isBinaryOp());
    return Name[Name.size() - 1];
  }

  unsigned getBinaryPrecedence() const { return Precedence; }
};
```

Basically, in addition to knowing a name for the prototype, we now keep track of whether it was an operator, and if it was, what precedence level the operator is at. The precedence is only used for binary operators (as you’ll see below, it just doesn’t apply for unary operators). Now that we have a way to represent the prototype for a user-defined operator, we need to parse it:

```
/// prototype
///   ::= id '(' id* ')'
///   ::= binary LETTER number? (id, id)
static std::unique_ptr<PrototypeAST> ParsePrototype() {
  std::string FnName;

  unsigned Kind = 0;  // 0 = identifier, 1 = unary, 2 = binary.
  unsigned BinaryPrecedence = 30;

  switch (CurTok) {
  default:
    return LogErrorP("Expected function name in prototype");
  case tok_identifier:
    FnName = IdentifierStr;
    Kind = 0;
    getNextToken();
    break;
  case tok_binary:
    getNextToken();
    if (!isascii(CurTok))
      return LogErrorP("Expected binary operator");
    FnName = "binary";
    FnName += (char)CurTok;
    Kind = 2;
    getNextToken();

    // Read the precedence if present.
    if (CurTok == tok_number) {
      if (NumVal < 1 || NumVal > 100)
        return LogErrorP("Invalid precedence: must be 1..100");
      BinaryPrecedence = (unsigned)NumVal;
      getNextToken();
    }
    break;
  }

  if (CurTok != '(')
    return LogErrorP("Expected '(' in prototype");

  std::vector<std::string> ArgNames;
  while (getNextToken() == tok_identifier)
    ArgNames.push_back(IdentifierStr);
  if (CurTok != ')')
    return LogErrorP("Expected ')' in prototype");

  // success.
  getNextToken();  // eat ')'.

  // Verify right number of names for operator.
  if (Kind && ArgNames.size() != Kind)
    return LogErrorP("Invalid number of operands for operator");

  return llvm::make_unique<PrototypeAST>(FnName, std::move(ArgNames), Kind != 0,
                                         BinaryPrecedence);
}
```

This is all fairly straightforward parsing code, and we have already seen a lot of similar code in the past. One interesting part about the code above is the couple lines that set up FnName for binary operators. This builds names like “binary@” for a newly defined “@” operator. It then takes advantage of the fact that symbol names in the LLVM symbol table are allowed to have any character in them, including embedded nul characters.

The next interesting thing to add, is codegen support for these binary operators. Given our current structure, this is a simple addition of a default case for our existing binary operator node:

```
Value *BinaryExprAST::codegen() {
  Value *L = LHS->codegen();
  Value *R = RHS->codegen();
  if (!L || !R)
    return nullptr;

  switch (Op) {
  case '+':
    return Builder.CreateFAdd(L, R, "addtmp");
  case '-':
    return Builder.CreateFSub(L, R, "subtmp");
  case '*':
    return Builder.CreateFMul(L, R, "multmp");
  case '<':
    L = Builder.CreateFCmpULT(L, R, "cmptmp");
    // Convert bool 0/1 to double 0.0 or 1.0
    return Builder.CreateUIToFP(L, Type::getDoubleTy(TheContext),
                                "booltmp");
  default:
    break;
  }

  // If it wasn't a builtin binary operator, it must be a user defined one. Emit
  // a call to it.
  Function *F = getFunction(std::string("binary") + Op);
  assert(F && "binary operator not found!");

  Value *Ops[2] = { L, R };
  return Builder.CreateCall(F, Ops, "binop");
}
```

As you can see above, the new code is actually really simple. It just does a lookup for the appropriate operator in the symbol table and generates a function call to it. Since user-defined operators are just built as normal functions (because the “prototype” boils down to a function with the right name) everything falls into place.

The final piece of code we are missing, is a bit of top-level magic:

```
Function *FunctionAST::codegen() {
  // Transfer ownership of the prototype to the FunctionProtos map, but keep a
  // reference to it for use below.
  auto &P = *Proto;
  FunctionProtos[Proto->getName()] = std::move(Proto);
  Function *TheFunction = getFunction(P.getName());
  if (!TheFunction)
    return nullptr;

  // If this is an operator, install it.
  if (P.isBinaryOp())
    BinopPrecedence[P.getOperatorName()] = P.getBinaryPrecedence();

  // Create a new basic block to start insertion into.
  BasicBlock *BB = BasicBlock::Create(TheContext, "entry", TheFunction);
  ...
```

Basically, before codegening a function, if it is a user-defined operator, we register it in the precedence table. This allows the binary operator parsing logic we already have in place to handle it. Since we are working on a fully-general operator precedence parser, this is all we need to do to “extend the grammar”.

Now we have useful user-defined binary operators. This builds a lot on the previous framework we built for other operators. Adding unary operators is a bit more challenging, because we don’t have any framework for it yet - let’s see what it takes.
